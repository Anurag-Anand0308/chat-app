Now this is a first mearn project. So we will write all the steps from starting to end.

Step1 : what are the tools we are going to use
frontend :- React  tailwind zusstand dc_ui
backend:- mongo express node socket.ioe

Step2 : we need to create two sperate forlders named backend and frontend

Step3 : go to frontend folder and create a react app
comands: `npm create vite@latest` . //for creating in the same folder

step4 : go to the backend and run comand
`npm init -y` // this creates the  package.json file. Which is used to store the metadata of the project

step5 : run the comand to install all the dependies used here
`npm i express mongoose dotenv jsonwebtoken bcryptjs cookie-parser cloudinary socket.io` // all this dependies will be used in this project. In above syntex the i refers to install.

Step6 : install a dev dependency nodemon
`npm i nodemon -D` // here D represent dev dependence

step7 : we create "index.js" file and work on it,
And after that we go to the package.json file and rewrite the script function as `"dev" : "nodemon index.js"` which sais that the site is running on the nodemon and the file name is index.js
after that we run `npm run dev`this comand in the backend folder and the output is the index,js file
